Intro to Robotics Class Labs
Lab 1: Find object - The lab uses OpenCV to implement a real-time object detection based on a user-specified color. The users select a color by clicking on the live video feed, dynamically updating the HSV range to detect objects of the selected color.
Lab 2: Rotate robot - This lab uses the robot to detect an object (which is selected based on the color of the object) using its camera, calculates its location, and rotates itself to face the object. Simultaneously, the camera feed is displayed on a userâ€™s computer.
Lab 3: Chase object - This lab allows the user to select the object's color (in HSV format) by clicking on the live video feed. The robot then detects the object based on that color, estimates its position and distance using camera and lidar data, and autonomously moves to follow the object while maintaining a desired distance.
Lab 4: Go to Goal - This lab uses lidar data to avoid obstacles to reach the pre-defined goal points.
Lab 5: Nav stack - This lab uses nav stack to autonomously navigate to a series of global waypoints (both the simualtion and the real robot). 
Lab 6: Navigating the Maze
